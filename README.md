# Crab'n'Cook Game

Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp 3th week project: Vanilla JavaScript 2D Canvas game.

## Description:

A Revenge Game

When a crab humilliate your father, a good son must avenge him... and that will be you duty! 
Based on the popular arcade game space Invaders, this game takes one more step to provide you 
with a slightly more complex challenge.

## Controls:

Use :arrow_up: to move up.
Use :arrow_down: to to move down.
Use :arrow_left: to move left.
Use :arrow_right: to move right.

Use "S" to shoot. Remember that shooting is the only way to kill the enemies, this is not a 
Super Mario. Don't try to smash them by passing over them!

The obstacles can't be passing by you, but the crabs can crawling under them to attack you, 
so beware! They can stop the knives, but not the enemies!
